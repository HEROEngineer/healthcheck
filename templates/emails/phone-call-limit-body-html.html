Hello,<br />
<p>
We could not deliver a phone call notification because your {% site_name %}
account has reached its monthly phone call limit of
<strong>{{ limit }} calls per month</strong>. The limit resets at the start of
each month.
</p>

{% if url %}
<p>You can increase the monthly phone call limit by upgrading your billing plan. <a href="{{ url }}">See Pricing</a>.</p>
