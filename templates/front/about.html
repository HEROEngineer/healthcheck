        <h3>Open Source</h3>
        <p>
            healthchecks.io is an open source project. The code is on
            <a href="https://github.com/healthchecks/healthchecks">GitHub</a>,
            it has BSD license, and is accepting contributions.
        </p>

        <h3>Reliability Guarantees</h3>
        <p>
            No warranties!<br />

            The service is currently run on a single $20 Digital Ocean box
            in NYC3.
            It does have daily database backups to Amazon S3.
            Multi-hour or even multi-day outages are possible.
            Still, <em>some monitoring is better
            than no monitoring!</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            There's also a number of alternative cron monitoring services, with
            different feature sets, different reliability guarantees and
            pricing options. If healthchecks.io doesn't seem like a good fit
