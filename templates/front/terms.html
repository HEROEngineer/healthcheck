<h3>Subscriptions</h3>
<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Monkey See Monkey Do SIA cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Monkey See Monkey Do SIA customer support team.</p>
<p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Monkey See Monkey Do SIA with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Monkey See Monkey Do SIA to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>

<p>Monkey See Monkey Do SIA will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
<p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
