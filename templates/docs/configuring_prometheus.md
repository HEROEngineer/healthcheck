# Configuring Prometheus

SITE_NAME supports exporting metrics and check statuses to
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), for use with [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

You can generate the metrics export endpoint by going to your project settings
and **creating a read-only API key**. You will then see the link to
the Prometheus endpoint:

![Project's API Keys](IMG_URL/prometheus_endpoint.png)

## Update the prometheus.yml

You can copy the Prometheus endpoint URL and add it to the Prometheus configuration:

```yaml
  - job_name: "healthchecks"
    scrape_interval: 60s
    scheme: SITE_SCHEME
    metrics_path: /projects/{your-project-uuid}/metrics/{your-readonly-api-key}
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["SITE_HOSTNAME"]
```

Notice how we split up the URL and paste in the scheme, domain, and path separately.

Reload Prometheus, and your changes should be live, coming in under the `hc_` prefix.

## Available Metrics

The Prometheus metrics endpoint exports the following metrics:

hc_check_up
:   For every check, indicates whether the check is currently up
    (1 for yes, 0 for no).

    Labels:

    * `name` – name of the check
    * `tags` – check's tags as a text string, multiple tags are delimited with spaces
    * `unique_key` – a stable, unique identifier of the check (derived from check's code)

hc_check_started
:   For every check, indicates whether the check is currently running
    (1 for yes, 0 for no).

    Labels:

    * `name` – name of the check
    * `tags` – check's tags as a text string, multiple tags are delimited with spaces
    * `unique_key` – a stable, unique identifier of the check (derived from check's code)

hc_tag_up
:   For every tag, indicates whether all checks with this tag are up
    (1 for yes, 0 for no).

    Labels:

    * `tag` – name of the tag

hc_checks_total
:   The total number of checks.

hc_checks_down_total
:   <br>The number of checks currently down.

## Constructing URLs to Check Details Pages

You can use the `unique_key` labels to construct URLs to check's
details pages in SITE_NAME. Construct the URLs like so:

```
SITE_ROOT/cloaked/{unique_key}/
```
