<h1>Email</h1>
<p>As an alternative to HTTP/HTTPS requests, you can "ping" checks by
sending email messages to special email addresses.</p>
<p><img alt="Email address for pinging via email" src="IMG_URL/emails.png" /></p>
<p>By default, SITE_NAME will consider any email received at the displayed address as
a "success" signal. You can also configure SITE_NAME to look for specific
keywords in the subject line or  the message body to decide if the message
is "success" or a "failure" signal. You can set up the keywords in the
<strong>Filtering Rules</strong> dialog:</p>

<h2>Use Case: Newsletter Delivery Monitoring</h2>
<p>Consider a cron job that runs weekly and sends weekly newsletters
to a list of email addresses. You have already set up a check to get alerted
when your cron job fails to run. But what you ultimately want to check is if
<strong>your emails are getting sent and delivered</strong>.</p>
<p>The solution: set up another check, and add its email address to your list of
recipient email addresses. Set its Period to 1 week. As long as your weekly email
script runs correctly, and there are no email delivery issues,
SITE_NAME will regularly receive an email, and the check will stay up.</p>
